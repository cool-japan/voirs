# Introduction

Welcome to VoiRS, a cutting-edge **Pure-Rust Neural Speech Synthesis Framework** that democratizes state-of-the-art text-to-speech technology.

## What is VoiRS?

VoiRS (Voice in Rust) is a comprehensive speech synthesis framework built entirely in Rust, offering:

- **🦀 Memory Safety**: Zero-cost abstractions with compile-time guarantees
- **⚡ High Performance**: Real-time synthesis with <0.3× RTF on consumer hardware  
- **🌍 Multi-platform**: Runs on x86_64, ARM64, WebAssembly, and GPU accelerators
- **🎯 Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade reliability and scalability
- **🔧 Developer Friendly**: Intuitive APIs and comprehensive tooling

## Why Choose VoiRS?
