## 📝 Development Notes

### Critical Dependencies
- `libc` for C API definitions
- `pyo3` for Python bindings
- `napi-rs` for Node.js bindings
- `once_cell` for static initialization
- `parking_lot` for efficient synchronization

### Architecture Decisions
- Opaque pointers for memory safety across FFI boundary
- Reference counting for shared resource management
- Thread-local error storage for thread safety
- Zero-copy design where possible

### Quality Gates
- All FFI functions must have comprehensive error handling
- Memory safety must be guaranteed across language boundaries
- Performance overhead must be minimized (<5% typical case)
- Thread safety must be ensured for all public APIs

This TODO list provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the voirs-ffi crate, focusing on safe, efficient, and user-friendly foreign function interfaces for multiple programming languages.
