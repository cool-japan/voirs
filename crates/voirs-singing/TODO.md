**Refactoring Achievement**: All large files have been successfully refactored into modular components following the 2000-line policy. Test suite passes with 225/225 tests successful. Code organization significantly improved with clean module boundaries, maintainable structure, and enhanced numerical stability. The physical modeling system now features 6 focused modules (core, advanced_physics, boundary_acoustic, tissue_molecular, solver, enhanced) providing comprehensive vocal tract simulation capabilities.

**Next Development Areas** (Future Research):
- Multi-speaker voice conversion and zero-shot singing
- Real-time neural synthesis optimization 
- Advanced musical understanding with large language models
- Production deployment and optimization
- Mobile and edge device optimization
