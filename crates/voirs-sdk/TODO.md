## 📝 Development Notes

### Critical Dependencies
- `tokio` for async runtime
- `serde` for configuration serialization
- `thiserror` for error handling
- `tracing` for structured logging
- All VoiRS component crates

### Architecture Decisions
- Unified API through trait objects for flexibility
- Builder pattern for discoverable configuration
- Async-first design for scalability
- Plugin system for extensibility

### Quality Gates
- All public APIs must be documented with examples
- Error handling must be comprehensive and user-friendly
- Performance must meet or exceed targets
- Backward compatibility must be maintained

This TODO list provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the voirs-sdk crate, focusing on creating a world-class developer experience while maintaining high performance and reliability.
