## üìù Notes & Guidelines

### Critical Success Factors
- **No warnings policy**: All code must compile without warnings
- **Workspace dependencies**: Use `workspace = true` for all common dependencies
- **Latest crates**: Always use latest stable versions from crates.io
- **Performance first**: Every change must include performance impact assessment
- **Quality gates**: Automated quality checks must pass before merge

### Architecture Principles
- **Modular design**: Each crate should have clear responsibilities
- **Async-first**: All I/O operations should be non-blocking
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error types with actionable messages
- **Observability**: Structured logging and metrics throughout
- **Security**: Input validation, safe defaults, and defensive programming

### Code Quality Standards
- **Test coverage**: >90% line coverage for all production code
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must have comprehensive docs
- **Examples**: Working examples for all major features
- **Benchmarks**: Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- **Integration**: End-to-end tests for user workflows

This roadmap serves as the single source of truth for VoiRS development priorities and should be updated regularly as implementation progresses.
