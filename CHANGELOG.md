# Changelog

All notable changes to VoiRS will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- DiffWave vocoder training pipeline with gradient-based updates, SafeTensors checkpointing, and improved CLI ergonomics for long-running training runs.
- Automatic IPA Kokoro demo leveraging eSpeak NG plus expanded training documentation covering streaming, batch, and evaluation workflows.

### Changed
- Replaced direct `rand`, `rustfft`, `realfft`, `num_complex`, `rayon`, and `ndarray` usage with `scirs2_*` abstractions (Beta 3) across the workspace to unify the DSP stack.
- Updated installation instructions, quick-start material, and roadmap to reflect the alpha.2 capabilities and training-first workflow.

### Known Issues
- Real FFT planner trait objects and `plan_fft_forward` support remain blocked pending SCIRS2 Beta 4; temporary functional FFT fallbacks ship in this release.
- A handful of `scirs2_core::random` and `parallel_ops` helpers still require upstream improvements‚Äîsee `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` for active workstreams.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2025-09-21

### Initial Alpha Release

This is the first public alpha release of VoiRS (Voice Synthesis in Rust), a cutting-edge Text-to-Speech / Speech Recognition framework built entirely in Rust.

#### üéØ Added

**Core Architecture:**
- Complete modular pipeline architecture (Text ‚Üí G2P ‚Üí Acoustic ‚Üí Vocoder ‚Üí Audio)
- Workspace-based crate organization with 14+ specialized components
- Unified public API through `voirs-sdk` crate

**Components:**

#### üîß Technical Details

**Performance:**
- Optimized for real-time synthesis (‚â§ 0.3√ó RTF on consumer CPUs)
- Memory-efficient implementation with streaming support
- GPU acceleration support (CUDA/Metal backends)

**Quality:**
- Neural models achieving high naturalness scores
- Support for multiple voice types and styles
- Advanced prosody and emotion control

**Security:**
- Memory-safe Rust implementation
- Secure consent management for voice cloning
- Privacy protection features

#### üö® Known Issues

**Dependencies:**
- 3 non-critical security advisories in transitive dependencies:
  - RSA timing sidechannel (medium) - from optional database features
  - slice-ring-buffer double-free - from optional audio codecs
  - time crate segfault (medium) - from optional audio interface
- 5 warnings for unmaintained dependencies (non-core features)

**Limitations:**
- Alpha quality - APIs may change in future releases
- Limited model zoo (production models coming in beta)
- Some advanced features are experimental
- Documentation improvements needed

#### üì¶ Breaking Changes

N/A - Initial release

#### üõ°Ô∏è Security
